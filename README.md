# Spooky-Site

I want to learn more of the practial skill of coding.

I made several changes to the site with JavaScript, making it so that it can start music, change things like the mouse with a click of a button, and even change the display of the site.

I wrote this software to bee able to have a site on which i could entertain fans of any future projects I may complete. I want to be able to share my work with the world, and make someone happy.

Here is a video demonstration of the code.

# Development Environment

The coding systems I used was VSCode. And the code was Javascript, HTML, and a little CSS.

# Useful Websites

These sites was invaluable to making the site work with these features.

# Future Work

This is a project that I will definatly work on again. Here are some things that I will eventually improve.
